        <h2>About The Man</h2>
        <p>Not much is known about the human Firebird. 
            The name he goes by is Bill and He is also the sweetest and most gentle soul I have ever met.
        How he does it I will never know. But I am sure glad to have met this 
    mysterious Firebird.</p>
